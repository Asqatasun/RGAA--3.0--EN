# RGAA Guidelines
## RGAA Version 3 2016

This repository provides an English version of the French government's General Accessibility Reference for Administrations: the RGAA. For legal constraints, the official version remains the one [in French](https://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/rgaa/). However you can use this English version with confidence, as it is as complete as the original one.

Although greatest care has been taken during translation, we acknowledge the fact that this text probably contains mistakes. You may write to [rgaa.sgmap@modernisation.gouv.fr](mailto:rgaa.sgmap@modernisation.gouv.fr), or open an issue here, if you feel corrections are needed.
